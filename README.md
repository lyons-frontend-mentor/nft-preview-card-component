### Built with

- HTML
- TailwindCSS

## Reflection

I feel like I'm getting the hang of Tailwind now, especially for these more basic challenges. Working from a Figma design and using Tailwind for styling seem to go very well together.

### Continued development

I want to continue completing the Newbie challenges using Tailwind so that I can learn all the properties in Tailwind. Since I already know the CSS, completing these challenges becomes a matter of either using the appropriate Tailwind class, or looking it up and then using it. I intend to complete more of these challenges until I rarely need to look at the Tailwind documentation. Then I'll try my hand at more difficult designs.
